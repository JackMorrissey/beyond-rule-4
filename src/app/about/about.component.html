      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>This application is a not-for-profit side-project of a <a href="http://jmmorrissey.com">software developer</a> chasing financial freedom. It was created with the intent of providing personal motivation of becoming debt free and continuing well beyond that goal.</p>
      <p>The announcement that <a href="https://www.youneedabudget.com/contest-ynab-api/">YNAB was having an API contest</a> gave me the motivation (and the ever needed deadline) to make this available for an audience bigger than myself. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to send me an email at <a href="mailto:beyondrule4@jmmorrissey.com">beyondrule4@jmmorrissey.com</a>.</p>
      <p>This application doesn't collect or store any personal data before or after authorizing with YNAB. We may use browser cookies or session storage for application functionality, but not to track behavior or collect information.</p>

      <h2>YNAB OAuth</h2>
      <p>This application follows the <a href="https://api.youneedabudget.com/#terms">Terms of Service for the YNAB API</a></p>

      <ul>
        <li>The data obtained through the YNAB API is not stored on the application server. We may use browser session storage and cookies for application functionality, but API data is only received and used by the client browser.</li>
        <li>Data obtained through the YNAB API will not unknowingly be passed to any third-party.</li>
        <li>The application will never ask for any financial account credentials.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>When we authorize with YNAB, we only ever read information. We do not add or edit any transactions to your account. (The YNAB API does not offer a read-only mode, otherwise we would use that.)</p>
