          <h1>About</h1>
          <p>This application is an <a href="https://github.com/JackMorrissey/beyond-rule-4" target="_blank">open source</a>
            side-project of a <a href="http://jmmorrissey.com">software developer</a> chasing financial freedom. It was
            created with the intent of providing personal motivation to become debt free and to continue well beyond
            that goal.</p>
          <p>The announcement that <a
              href="https://www.youneedabudget.com/announcing-the-ynab-api-contest-winners/" target="_blank">YNAB was having an API
              contest</a> gave me the motivation (and the ever needed deadline) to make this available for an audience
            bigger than myself. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to send me an email at <a
              href="mailto:beyondrule4@jmmorrissey.com">beyondrule4&#64;jmmorrissey.com</a>.</p>
          <p>This application doesn't collect or store any personal data before or after authorizing with YNAB. We may
            use browser cookies or browser local/session storage for application functionality and analytics but nothing
            nefarious.</p>
          <p>When we authorize with YNAB, we request read-only access. We do not add or edit any information to your
            account or budget.</p>
          <p>To revoke authorization at any time, visit <a
              href="https://app.youneedabudget.com/settings" target="_blank">https://app.youneedabudget.com/settings</a>, scroll to
            "Authorized Applications", and click "Revoke" for Beyond Rule 4. Thanks for trying it out!</p>
          <p>This application is not sponsored, endorsed, or supported by YNAB.</p>
